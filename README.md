<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# Order Food

## Development Setup

During development, you may encounter Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues.

### CORS Chrome Extension

To overcome CORS issues in your development environment, you can use the "CORS" Chrome extension. This extension allows you to temporarily disable CORS restrictions in your browser, making it easier to test and develop your application.

1. Install the [CORS Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf).

2. Once the extension is installed, make sure it's enabled when testing your Swiggy WebApp Clone in the browser.

**Note:** The CORS extension is intended for development purposes only. Ensure that you disable the extension when accessing other websites for security reasons.
